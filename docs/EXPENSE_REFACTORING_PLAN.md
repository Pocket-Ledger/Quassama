# Expense Model Refactoring Plan

## üî¥ Current Problem
- **Single file**: 2,248 lines
- **40+ methods**: All in one class
- **Mixed concerns**: CRUD, balances, analytics, settlements, reports
- **Hard to maintain**: Finding and testing specific functionality is difficult
- **Poor scalability**: Adding new features makes the file even larger

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Structure

### **New Directory Layout**
```
models/expense/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js                    # Main export (for backward compatibility)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Expense.js                  # Core expense entity (200 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExpenseCRUD.js             # Create, Read, Update, Delete (300 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExpenseBalance.js          # Balance calculations (400 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExpenseSettlement.js       # Settlement logic (300 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExpenseAnalytics.js        # Statistics and reports (400 lines)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExpenseRecurring.js        # Recurring expense logic (200 lines)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ExpenseQueries.js          # Complex queries and filters (250 lines)
```

---

## üìÅ Detailed Breakdown

### **1. Expense.js** (Core Entity - ~200 lines)
**Purpose**: Basic expense class and validation
```javascript
class Expense {
  constructor(title, amount, category, note, group_id, splits = null)
  validate()
  async save()
  async createSplitNotifications(expenseId, creatorName)
}
```

**Methods to keep here**:
- `constructor()`
- `validate()`
- `save()`
- `createSplitNotifications()`

---

### **2. ExpenseCRUD.js** (~300 lines)
**Purpose**: Basic CRUD operations
```javascript
class ExpenseCRUD {
  static async getExpenseByID(expenseId)
  static async updateExpense(expenseId, updateData)
  static async deleteExpenseByID(expenseId)
  static async deleteExpensesByGroup(groupId)
  static async GetAllExpenseByUser()
  static async RecentlyActivityByUser()
  static async getExpensesByGroup(groupId)
  static async getExpensesByGroupWithLimit(groupId, n)
  static async getExpensesByUserAndGroup(userId, groupId)
}
```

**Why separate?**
- Clear responsibility: Only handles database operations
- Easy to test CRUD operations independently
- Can add caching layer without affecting other modules

---

### **3. ExpenseBalance.js** (~400 lines)
**Purpose**: All balance-related calculations
```javascript
class ExpenseBalance {
  static async calculateGroupBalances(groupId)
  static async getUserBalanceForGroup(groupId)
  static async getBalanceByUserAndGroup(groupId, startDate, endDate)
  static async getBalanceByAllUsersInGroup(groupId, startDate, endDate)
  static async getTotalOwedToUser()
  static async getTotalYouOwe()
  static async getTotalExpensesByGroup(groupId)
  static async getTotalExpensesPerUserByGroup(groupId)
  static async getTotalExpensesByUserAndGroup(groupId)
  static async getTotalExpensesByUser()
  static async getTotalExpensesByGroupInRange(groupId, startDate, endDate)
  static async getTotalExpensesPerUserByGroupInRange(groupId, startDate, endDate)
}
```

**Why separate?**
- Balance logic is complex and should be isolated
- Easier to test calculations independently
- Can optimize balance algorithms without touching other code
- Clear domain boundary

---

### **4. ExpenseSettlement.js** (~300 lines)
**Purpose**: Settlement and debt resolution
```javascript
class ExpenseSettlement {
  static async settleUpGroup(groupId)
  static async createSettlementTransaction(fromUser, toUser, amount, groupId)
  static async getSettlementHistory(groupId)
  static async validateSettlement(groupId)
}
```

**Why separate?**
- Settlement is a distinct business process
- Complex algorithm that needs isolated testing
- May need to add features like partial settlements, scheduled settlements, etc.

---

### **5. ExpenseAnalytics.js** (~400 lines)
**Purpose**: Reports, statistics, and analytics
```javascript
class ExpenseAnalytics {
  static async getExpenseOverview(groupId, month, year)
  static async getExpenseOverviewAllGroups(month, year)
  static async getExpenseDetailsByCategory(groupId, month, year)
  static async getExpenseReport(groupId, month, year)
  static async getExpenseTrendsByMonth(groupId, months)
  static async getCategoryBreakdown(groupId, startDate, endDate)
}
```

**Why separate?**
- Analytics is a separate concern from core operations
- May need different caching strategies
- Can add BI features without bloating core code
- Performance optimization can be isolated

---

### **6. ExpenseRecurring.js** (~200 lines)
**Purpose**: Recurring expense management
```javascript
class ExpenseRecurring {
  static async createRecurringExpense(expenseData, startDate, monthsToCreate)
  static async getRecurringExpenses(groupId)
  static async deleteRecurringExpenseSeries(title, startDate)
  static async updateRecurringSeries(seriesId, updateData)
  static async pauseRecurringSeries(seriesId)
}
```

**Why separate?**
- Recurring logic is a feature, not core to expenses
- May need scheduled jobs/cron support later
- Can be disabled/enabled as a feature toggle

---

### **7. ExpenseQueries.js** (~250 lines)
**Purpose**: Complex queries, filtering, and pagination
```javascript
class ExpenseQueries {
  static async getExpensesByGroupPaginated(groupId, page, pageSize)
  static async getExpensesByGroupCursor(groupId, pageSize, lastDoc)
  static async searchExpenses(query, filters)
  static async filterExpensesByDateRange(groupId, startDate, endDate)
  static async filterExpensesByCategory(groupId, categories)
  static async getExpensesByMultipleGroups(groupIds)
}
```

**Why separate?**
- Query logic can get very complex
- Pagination strategies may evolve
- Search features can be enhanced independently

---

### **8. index.js** (Backward Compatibility)
**Purpose**: Export all modules under single namespace
```javascript
// Re-export everything to maintain backward compatibility
import Expense from './Expense';
import ExpenseCRUD from './ExpenseCRUD';
import ExpenseBalance from './ExpenseBalance';
import ExpenseSettlement from './ExpenseSettlement';
import ExpenseAnalytics from './ExpenseAnalytics';
import ExpenseRecurring from './ExpenseRecurring';
import ExpenseQueries from './ExpenseQueries';

// Combine all static methods into main Expense class
Object.assign(Expense, ExpenseCRUD);
Object.assign(Expense, ExpenseBalance);
Object.assign(Expense, ExpenseSettlement);
Object.assign(Expense, ExpenseAnalytics);
Object.assign(Expense, ExpenseRecurring);
Object.assign(Expense, ExpenseQueries);

export default Expense;
export {
  ExpenseCRUD,
  ExpenseBalance,
  ExpenseSettlement,
  ExpenseAnalytics,
  ExpenseRecurring,
  ExpenseQueries
};
```

**Benefits:**
- No breaking changes to existing code
- `import Expense from 'models/expense/Expense'` still works
- Can gradually migrate to specific imports: `import { ExpenseBalance } from 'models/expense'`

## üöÄ Migration Strategy

### **Phase 1: Prepare** (1 day)
1. Create new directory structure
2. Set up index.js with re-exports
3. Add tests to ensure no breaking changes

### **Phase 2: Extract Modules** (2-3 days)
1. Start with ExpenseCRUD (simplest)
2. Then ExpenseQueries
3. Then ExpenseRecurring
4. Then ExpenseSettlement
5. Then ExpenseBalance (most complex)
6. Finally ExpenseAnalytics

### **Phase 3: Refactor Imports** (1-2 days)
1. Update imports in screens
2. Update imports in other models
3. Update imports in tests

### **Phase 4: Cleanup** (1 day)
1. Remove old Expense.js (keep backup)
2. Update documentation
3. Run full test suite

## üìã Code Example

### **Before** (Current - 2248 lines)
```javascript
import Expense from 'models/expense/Expense';

// All 40+ methods in one file
await Expense.save();
await Expense.calculateGroupBalances(groupId);
await Expense.settleUpGroup(groupId);
await Expense.getExpenseOverview(groupId, month, year);
```

### **After** (Modular)
```javascript
// Option 1: Use combined export (backward compatible)
import Expense from 'models/expense';
await Expense.save();
await Expense.calculateGroupBalances(groupId);

// Option 2: Use specific modules (recommended for new code)
import Expense from 'models/expense/Expense';
import { ExpenseBalance } from 'models/expense';
import { ExpenseSettlement } from 'models/expense';
import { ExpenseAnalytics } from 'models/expense';

await new Expense(data).save();
await ExpenseBalance.calculateGroupBalances(groupId);
await ExpenseSettlement.settleUpGroup(groupId);
await ExpenseAnalytics.getExpenseOverview(groupId, month, year);
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Don't rush**: Refactor incrementally, test after each module
2. **Keep Git history**: Don't delete old file until all tests pass
3. **Update documentation**: Keep README and API docs in sync
4. **Communicate with team**: Make sure everyone knows about the changes
5. **Use feature flags**: Can toggle between old/new implementation during transition

---

## üéì Learning Resources

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module should have one reason to change
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different concerns should be in different modules
- **SOLID Principles**: Apply to class design
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain logic separated from infrastructure

---

## üìä Estimated Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| File Size | 2,248 lines | 200-400 lines each | ‚úÖ 82% reduction per file |
| Methods per file | 40+ | 5-10 | ‚úÖ 75% reduction |
| Test time | ~30 seconds | ~5 seconds per module | ‚úÖ 83% faster |
| Code review | 1 hour+ | 10-15 minutes | ‚úÖ 75% faster |
| Onboarding time | 2-3 days | 1 day | ‚úÖ 50% faster |

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendation

**YES, absolutely refactor this!** 

Start with the simplest modules first (ExpenseCRUD, ExpenseQueries) to build confidence, then tackle the complex ones (ExpenseBalance, ExpenseSettlement).

The investment will pay off immediately in:
- Faster development
- Fewer bugs
- Better code quality
- Happier developers üòä
